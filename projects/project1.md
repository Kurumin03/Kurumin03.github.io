# Path Planning using A* Algorithm  
*lab Experiment, Ritsumeikan University*

<hr/>

## Introduction  
Milling removes material via rotary cutters—used for grooving, boring, drilling, etc.  
Without proper guarding, operators risk injuries from flying chips or entanglement.

<hr/>

## Project Background  
- Between 1992–2010, machinery accidents caused 14,625 deaths (avg. 770/year).  
- Many conventional milling machines lack safety covers, exposing operators to hazards.

## Problem Statement  
- **Sharp metal chips** can fly off and injure the operator.  
- **No barrier** separates the operator from the rotating blade.  
- **Lack of maintenance** increases risk over time.

<hr/>

## Objectives  
1. **Identify & analyze** hazards of horizontal milling machines.  
2. **Design** a durable, easy‐to‐install safety cover that does not impede operation.  
3. **Evaluate** cover effectiveness through testing and simulation.  
4. **Promote** safety cover use as best practice in industry.

<hr/>

## Methodology  
1. **Research & Reference Gathering (W1–W6)** – Survey safety standards & existing cover designs.  
2. **CAD Modeling (W3–W6)** – Sketch concepts; refine with 2D/3D CAD drawings.  
3. **Manufacturing (W7–W9)** – Fabricate using cutting, bending, welding; assemble & inspect.  
4. **Documentation (W10–W12)** – Compile thesis: literature review, design, manufacturing, test results.

<hr/>

## Experiment Study  
Tested cover’s ability to block chips, maintain machine function, and reduce floor debris.

## Final Outcomes  
- **Objective 1:** Identified key hazards of unguarded milling machines.  
- **Objective 2:** Created a cover that does not interfere with machine operation.  
- **Objective 3:** Demonstrated chip containment and reduced floor debris.

<hr/>

<hr/>

## Conclusions  
- Safety cover meets design goals: effective protection, ease of use, minimal interference.  
- Reinforced the importance of guarding in reducing machinery‐related injuries.

<hr/>

## Future Plans  
- Improve base durability and add mechanisms for easy opening/closing.  
- Integrate additional features: lighting, chip disposal, coolant spray.
